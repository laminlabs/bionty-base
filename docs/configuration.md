## Configuration

### On the various yaml files

Bionty tracks all supported and the currently active ontologies four `*.yaml` files.

1. `versions.yaml`: Stores all available ontologies. Users should not edit this file.
2. `_current.yaml`: Stores the currently active ontologies. Users should never edit this file.
3. `_lndb.yaml`: Stores the currently active ontologies as defined by lamindb. Users should never edit this file.
4. `_local.yaml`: Stores all locally available ontologies. Users may edit this file.

The available and currently active ontologies can also be printed to the console with `TBD`.
