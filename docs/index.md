# Bionty: Manage biological entities

*Call the same things the same names.*

Bionty is a performant API for interacting with biological entities. It unambiguously maps scientific standards and features auto-complete.

Currently, it's main use case is to standardize & organize data with biological entities as the frame of reference.

This should make data queries more intuitive and data science more robust & organized.

Eventually, we hope that an open API will enable collaborative data science across organiations at scale.

For a full data & analysis management system leveraging Bionty, consider [LaminDB](https://lamin.ai/lamindb).
